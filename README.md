# Student-result-management-system

This project proposes a comprehensive Student Result Management System (SRMS) using, Tkinter, SQLite, Pandas and Matplotlib. The SRMS offers an intuitive and efficient platform for managing student academic records, incorporating features such as course management, student enrollment, result recording, and result viewing. The graphical user interface, implemented with Tkinter, ensures a visually appealing design. The system dynamically updates and displays total counts of courses, students, and results in real time. Additionally, SRMS includes features for generating a graphical overview of student performance and exporting all student result data to an Excel file. The project employs a robust testing approach, covering various aspects, and suggests future improvements, including voice recognition and database synchronization. The Student Result Management System reflects a promising trajectory in digital solutions for educational technology, emphasizing continuous improvement and adaptation to meet user expectations.
